# glyphs

An R package for creating glyphs for use in visualization by Jack (Jiahua) Liu and Wayne Oldford

Any plot produced by the graphics package or the grid package can be turned into a glyph.

Includes methods for space-filling glyphs for:

- Hilbert-Peano curves
- Morton curves
- Daniel Keim's recursive rectangular layout curves (excellent for time-ordered data).
